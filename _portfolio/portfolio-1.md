Grasslands are vast, open areas dominated by grasses and herbaceous plants, with few trees and shrubs. They are found on every continent except Antarctica and are characterized by their rich biodiversity and unique ecological roles. Grasslands are home to a wide variety of animals, including large herbivores like bison and antelope, as well as predators such as wolves and big cats. They play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, as the deep root systems of grasses help sequester carbon in the soil. Grasslands are also important for agriculture, providing grazing land for livestock and habitat for pollinators. However, they are under threat from factors such as agriculture, urbanization, and climate change, leading to their degradation and loss.
